Repositories get pushed into git hub using the command git push RemoteRepositoryName LocalRepositoryName

Que: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used to carry out GitHub to GitHub copying. When you are copying someone else's repository it is advisable to
use fork instead of clone. 
Cloning is also copying github repository but this time to your local directory.
Branching can be created in a repository to reflect a different branch in the development of the document. For example if different 
collaborating on a document they could form branches etc.

Git fetch can be used to get a copy of the repository in github, when you do not want to immediately merge it with your master.
For example you want to get the latest copy of what is in github before you go and work offline. You can merge the contents that you
have fetched rom github with your master as follows
git merge master origin/master.  This command combined with git fetch has the same effect as git pull origin master.

Conflicts may arise. When they do resolve them by accepting/implimenting the changes you want in the relevant files. Then
add, commit and push to be up to date with github
