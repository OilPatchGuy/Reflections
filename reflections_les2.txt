When you initialise a repository it creates an empty container in which you need to add data.
Staging srea is like a holding area. It is thee stage between the working directory and the repository. It contains the items that are in line to be commited.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You add the files per logical change one at a time into the staging area
When to create a branch: 1. When I am testing out a new idea. 2. When I am trying to isolate a bug.

How diagrams help: The diagrams help in tracing the path of new branches. Isolated branches become very clear.
